    //  yqueue allows one thread to use push/back function and another one 
    //  to use pop/front functions. However, user must ensure that there's no
    //  pop on the empty queue and that both threads don't access the same
    //  element in unsynchronised manner.

    //  N is granularity of the queue (how many pushes have to be done till
    //  actual memory allocation is required)
