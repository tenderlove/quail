This directory contains a simple example of sending raw video from a webcam
over 0MQ.

To build the code you need to have the SDL development libraries
(libsdl1.2-dev in Debian) and the Unicap library from
http://www.unicap-imaging.org/ installed.

The wire format for messages sent from sender to receiver is:
<width, height, frame data>
width:      uint32_t: frame width in pixels (network byte order)
height:     uint32_t: frame height in pixels (network byte order)
frame data: RGB24 frame data (R, G, B: 3 octets per pixel)

TODO:

- figure out why unicap sometimes fails to open the video device
- figure out why ucil_convert_buffer sometimes fails
- send patch to upstream to fix ucil.h for C++
